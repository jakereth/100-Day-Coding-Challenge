# 100-Day-Coding-Challenge
I am going to be completing the 100 day coding challenge course to master Python and upload the daily projects.
I already do have experience using Python but I would like to master it, the challenge course consists of daily lessons and projects that will increase in difficulty as the days go on.
I will be uploading every single project I make throughout the course to document it.
The initial projects will be extremely simple so bear with me until we finally get to some of the more interesting projects involving automation and web scraping.
